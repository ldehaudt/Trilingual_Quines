# Quines

Quines are programs that output there own source code. While a simple quine is not overly complex, adding defferent behavior to 
a quine can prove more complicated. In this project, I created three varrying quines in C, Assembely, and python, for a total of 9 quines.

Nothing too flashy for this project, I hope you still enjoy ^-^.
